<h1>Introduction</h1>
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is analyzed to gain insights into sales performance and customer purchasing patterns. The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven recommendations on which products the company should focus on and to suggest suitable marketing campaigns that align more effectively with market demand.

The dataset consists of 11 columns, each representing an attribute of a product purchase:
<ul>
  <li> Order ID – A unique identifier for each order placed </li>

  <li> Product – The item that was purchased </li>
  <li>Quantity Ordered – The number of units ordered for that product</li>
  <li>Price Each – The price of a single unit of the product</li>
  <li>Order Date – The date on which the order was placed</li>
  <li>Purchase Address – The shipping address of the order</li>
  <li>Month, Sales, City, Hour – Additional attributes derived from the columns above</li>
</ul>

To achieve the overall objective, this analysis aims to answer five key business questions:

1. What was the best month for sales, and how much revenue was generated in that month?

2. Which city had the highest sales volume?

3. At what time of day should advertisements be displayed to maximize the likelihood of purchases?

4. Which products are most frequently sold together?

5. Which product sold the most, and why might it have been the top seller?
